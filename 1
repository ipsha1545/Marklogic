Q- how you loaded documents into the database in step 3.

I loaded the documents into the database with the help DocumentWrite() method in my code.The steps are as follows:-

1.Initially,I created a database client by specifying the details of host, port database etc

2.After that,I called a method runShortcut() where I created an InputStream and specified the filename to be inserted.Next I created an XML document manager, an identifier for the element and wrote the document content.In a similar way,I loaded all the xml files by using for loop
